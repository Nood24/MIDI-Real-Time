Hardware
The hardware for this project consisted of a Raspberry Pi model 3 B+ and a set of custom made pedals. The pedals work by sending a signal to the Raspberry Pi through the GPIO pins when a button is pressed. Each button controlls a different state on the Raspberry Pi. 

State 1 was configured for changing to the previous song, 
State 2 changes to the next song
State 3 starts or stops the current song
States 4&5 were added for redundancy

Overview
This folder contains the Schematic and PCB design layout for the hardware in addition to the code initially written for the hardware


Software
ORCAD 17.2 was used for the design of the circuit schematic and PCB layout of this project

The hardware could not be completed due to the preferred components not arriving on time, and unforeseen circumstances (COVID-19).
